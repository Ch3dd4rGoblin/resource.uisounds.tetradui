# resource.uisounds.tetradui_og

This repository contains the soundpack addon that was used by default with MC360 and has been adapted to modern Kodi.
This soundpack is intended to be used in conjunction with TetradUI. It is dubbed "OG" because its the sounds of the original Xbox 360 dashboard and MC360. 

Credit to Team Blackbolt for the creation of the these sound effects.
