About TetradUI OG Sounds
==============

TetradUI is a Graphical User Interface for Kodi media center, a open-source application available on multiple platforms.

The aim with TetradUI OG UI sounds addon was to bring the sounds of MC360 back as an add-on for modern Kodi releases. Credit to Team Blackbolt for the creation of the sounds contained in this addon.
The sounds are pulled directly out of the MC360 skin for XBMC and repackaged as a UI Sounds addon. The "OG" sounds addon was created by TeamUI in 2021/2022.
