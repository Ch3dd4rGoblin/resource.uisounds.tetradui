# resource.uisounds.tetradui_og

This repository contains a soundpack addon with sound effects that were used by default with MC360 and has been adapted for modern Kodi.
This soundpack was created for TetradUI. It is dubbed "OG" because its the sounds inspired from the original Xbox 360 dashboard. 

Credit to Team Blackbolt for the creation of the these sound effects.
